                <h2 class="heading-2">LCGC - Low Cost Green Car</h2>
                <p class="paragraph-2">is an Indonesian automobile regulation which exempts low-cost and energy-efficient cars from luxury sales tax to ensure the affordability, provided they are assembled locally with a minimum amount of local components. The introduction
                    of LCGC in Indonesia was meant to encourage the motorcycle owners/public transportation users to be able to afford their first cars, to reduce fuel subsidy and to compete with Thailand-imported cars, thus creating more jobs locally.
                    In some aspects, the regulation is similar to the Japanese kei car category and Thai Eco Car program which also promises tax cuts for small and efficient cars.

                <p class="paragraph-1">is a new term in the last few years, referring to a "multi-purpose vehicle" or "multi-person vehicle." MPVs are designed to carry passengers on regular trips. What these vehicles do particularly well is provide ease of access, with modern
                    boxy designs that also provide ample storage capacity and overall passenger comfort.

                <h2 class="heading-2">Sedans & Hatchback</h2>
                <p class="paragraph-2"><strong>Sedans</strong> is a passenger car in a three-box configuration with separate compartments for engine, passenger, and cargo. Sedan's first recorded use as a name for a car body was in 1912. The name comes from a 17th-century development
                    of a litter, the sedan chair, a one-person enclosed box with windows and carried by porters.
                    <br />
                    <strong>Hatchback</strong> is a car body configuration with a rear door that swings upward to provide access to a cargo area. Hatchbacks may feature fold-down second row seating, where the interior can be reconfigured to prioritize
                    passenger or cargo volume. Hatchbacks may feature two- or three-box design.
